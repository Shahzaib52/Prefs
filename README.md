# Prefs

Prefs is a powerful and flexible solution for storing and retrieving object data within the Unity game engine. Designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, this repository provides a convenient way to save and load data from PlayerPrefs.

With Prefs, users can store any object data using PlayerPrefs, from basic game settings and player preferences to complex game state data and inventory systems.

Prefs can help you streamline your development process and overcome the limitations of PlayerPrefs class that Unity provides, Prefs uses Newtonsoft Json plugin for Unity to serialise and deserialise data, so make sure you have this installed.
